    <h1>SoundDrop -The History behind the App</h1>

    <p>SoundDrop was first created in 2014 by Brigitte, Caroline and Michelle, then interns at SoundCloud, with Duana Stanley as product manager. Initially, SoundDrop was based on QR codes. 'Drops' were located throughout the SoundCloud office in Berlin, where employees created personal stories attached to interesting objects and places.</p>

    <p>Over the summer 2015, the project was followed up by Rails Girls Summer of Code fellows Franzi and Nynne with coaching from Erik Michaels-Ober and mentoring from Duana Stanley and Tam Eastley. SoundDrop is maintained by a small core group of diehard SoundDroppers :)</p>
